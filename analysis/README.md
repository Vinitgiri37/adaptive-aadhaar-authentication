Exploratory analysis of Aadhaar Biometric Update patterns,
including age-wise and region-wise volatility analysis.
This analysis identifies key patterns from the Aadhaar Biometric Update dataset:

1. Biometric updates occur across almost all regions
2. Age transition (5–17 to 17+) shows highest volatility
3. Significant regional variation exists in biometric update frequency
4. Patterns are consistent over time

These observations form the basis for adaptive Aadhaar authentication.
