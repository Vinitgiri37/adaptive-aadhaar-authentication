Logic for computing the Biometric Reliability Score (BRS)
based on biometric update frequency and age volatility.
Biometric Reliability Score (BRS) is a derived metric used to estimate
the stability of Aadhaar biometrics across regions and age groups.

Conceptual Formula:
BRS ∝ 1 / (Biometric Update Frequency × Age Volatility Factor)

Higher update frequency implies lower biometric reliability.

This score is used only for policy decision-making,
not for individual identification.
